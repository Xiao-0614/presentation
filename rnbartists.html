				<h2>
					1. Michael Jackson
				  </h2>
				  <p>
					A dynamic force as the pre-teen frontman of chart-topping family group 
					The Jackson 5, Michael Jackson moonwalked his way into solo superstardom. 
					More than 30 years after its debut, the singer/songwriter’s multi-platinum 
					Thriller remains one of the best-selling albums of all time. 
					Between his supple tenor and mesmerizing footwork, Jackson reigns 
					as the ultimate showman influencing current (Usher, Chris Brown, 
					Justin Timberlake) and future generations.

					2. Marvin Gaye
				  </h2>
				  <p>
					Marvin Gaye’s sensuous tenor had already left an impressive imprint during 
					a ‘60s run that included engaging duets with Tammi Terrell and a spirited 
					revamp of “I Heard It Through the Grapevine.” Then the preacher’s kid answered 
					his true calling — and redefined R&B/soul — with the socially themed 1971 
					landmark album What’s Going On. Gaye’s battle between spirituality versus 
					sexuality erupted on the provocative follow-up Let’s Get It On. 
					He soared back into limelight in 1983 with “Sexual Healing” and — 
					at the opposite end of the spectrum — a soulful reading of the National Anthem. 
					Still a formidable influence after his tragic 1984 death, Gaye made headlines 
					last year when his “Got to Give it Up” was the focus of a sampling 
					lawsuit involving Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines.”

					3. Whitney Houston
				  </h2>
				  <p>
					Descended from R&B/gospel/pop royalty—mom Cissy (Sweet Inspirations member 
					whose group did backing vocals for Elvis Presley and Aretha Franklin) and 
					cousin Dionne Warwick — Whitney Houston hit the ground running in 1985 with 
					debut single/first R&B No. 1 “You Give Good Love.” Her powerful, soaring 
					four-octave mezzo-soprano netted Houston, aka The Voice, immediate 
					superstardom through a spate of subsequent hits and top-selling soundtracks 
					(The Bodyguard, Waiting to Exhale, The Preacher’s Wife). 
					Her enduring legacy is credited with influencing such singers 
					as Beyoncé and Jennifer Hudson.

					4. Babyface
				  </h2>
				  <p>
					Known for his enviable hit list of writer/production credits for everyone 
					from TLC, Usher and Toni Braxton to Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson and Beyoncé, 
					Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds became a winning artist in his own right in 1989 with 
					the No. 1 single “It’s No Crime.” That was followed in short order by 
					a string of hits through the ‘90s including “Tender Lover,” “Whip Appeal,” 
					“Never Keeping Secrets” and “When Can I See You.” The multi-instrumentalist’s romantic, 
					mellow tenor melded with Braxton’s deep alto on the Grammy-winning 
					2014 duets album Love, Marriage & Divorce.

				<h2>
					5. Beyoncé
				  </h2>
				  <p>
					Substitute R&B’s Destiny’s Child for The Supremes and it’s easy to see 
					the parallels between Diana Ross’ superstar trajectory and Beyoncé’s. 
					A compelling and creative force as the frontwoman for music’s last 
					great girl group, Beyoncé hasn’t looked back since her solo album debut with 
					2003’s Dangerously in Love. Taking the gauntlet from Ross, Michael and 
					Janet Jackson and aiming for the stratosphere, Beyoncé’s creative fearlessness 
					and distinctive four-octave vocal range have tackled female sexuality/empowerment, 
					love and relationships via a core R&B sound that adventurously 
					integrates soul, funk, hip-hop, pop and other elements.

				<h2>
					6. Alicia Keys
				  </h2>
				  <p>
					Breakthrough singles “Fallin’” and “A Woman’s Worth” on 2001 debut album Songs 
					in A Minor set the tone for Alicia Keys’ storied career. Mentored by Clive Davis, 
					the singer/songwriter and accomplished pianist has racked up additional 
					hits “You Don’t Know My Name,” “If I Ain’t Got You,” “Like You’ll Never See Me Again, 
					“No One” and guest stint on Jay Z’s “Empire State of Mind.” Keys’ hallmarks 
					are passionate vocals and a music style incorporating the influences 
					of Donny Hathaway, Nina Simone and Prince.

				<h2>
					7. Ne-Yo
				  </h2>
				  <p>
					What makes Ne-Yo great is his ability to write a song effortlessly. 
					He deserves to be on this list not only for his solo contributions 
					but for what he’s done for other artists. Beyonce was already a force 
					in music, but when Ne-Yo gave her “Irreplaceable,” 
					she started to go to another level. Furthermore, Ne-Yo has 
					one of the most impressive first four solo album runs of any 
					male R&B singer in the 21st century.

					8. Mariah Carey
				  </h2>
				  <p>
					Mariah Carey was the voice of the 90s and early 2000s. 
					Consistently releasing hit after hit and breaking records helped her music 
					define an era. Her ability to seamlessly transition from pop ballads, 
					soul and hip-hop heavily contributed to her success, making 
					her one of the most successful artists of all time.

				<h2>
					9. Mary J. Blige
				  </h2>
				  <p>
					Mary J. Blige is simply one of the most significant figures in R&B 
					from the last 40 years. Aside from her incredible list of accolades 
					(8 platinum albums, 9 Grammys, Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations, etc.), 
					she helped usher in a new sound and style dubbed “Hip-Hop/Soul” that changed R&B 
					forever upon the release of her 1992 debut, What’s The 411? Mary’s greatest contribution to 
					R&B is her ability to foster deep connections with her audience through her music. 
					She’s made us cry, fall in love and feel empowered with her rich catalog for 
					well over two decades and doesn’t seem to be stopping anytime soon.
