				<h2>
					1. ‘Fantasy’ – Mariah Carey
				</h2>
				<p>
					   Mariah is rightly lauded for her multi-octave vocals and late-career 
					   reinvention as the Queen of Christmas, but as a songwriter, 
					   she's still somewhat underrated. This effervescent mid-'90s R&B song 
					   shows off her formidable musical brain: sampling Tom Tom Club's 1981 hit 
					   'Genius of Love' is a total boss move, and refashioning it into all-time 
					   great summer jam is pure class.

				<h2>
					2. ‘Climax’ – Usher
				</h2>
				<p>
					   Usher Raymond IV has a brace of potential entries into the pantheon of 
					   best old R&B songs. So, why 2010’s ‘Climax’? Well, firstly, 
					   factor in the uncharacteristically restrained production from Diplo 
					   (not to mention the string arrangement from Björk collaborator Nico Muhly). 
					   Then, add that falsetto: a thick stream of high-pitched, sadsack emoting that 
					   only a few men on the planet could pull off without serious injury. 
					   Mix them together and you have the perfect modern R&B record – 
					   one that proves the genre has the ability to reinvent itself for generations to come.

				<h2>
					3. ‘Milkshake’ – Kelis
				</h2>
				<p>
					   Written and produced by The Neptunes a.k.a Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, 
					   this minimalist R&B banger became an instant classic when it dropped in 2004. 
					   Kelis sells its brilliant hook so convincingly – who could doubt the fact her 
					   milkshake brings all the boys to the yard? – that it’s kind of weird to hear 
					   it was originally offered to Britney Spears. In R&B as in life, some things are just meant to be.

					4. ‘This Is How We Do It’ – Montell Jordan
				</h2>
				<p>
					   Did anyone happen to wonder, back in 1995, how a young, Def Jam-signed singer 
					   got his sexy A-game on before a weekend of partying? If they did, Montell Jordan 
					   was only too happy to explain, via his unashamedly raunchy, upbeat, 
					   Billboard Chart-smashing debut R&B song.

				<h2>
					5. ‘Freak Like Me’ – Adina Howard
				</h2>
				<p>
					   The slow, sultry grooves and anthemic, gospel-indebted chorus of Adina Howard’s 
					   Sly And The Family Stone-sampling debut single still sound just as slinky today 
					   'as they did in 1995. She never really came close to bettering ‘Freak Like Me’ 
					   (though she certainly tried to out-sex it in songs like ‘Buttnaked’ and ‘Sexual Needs’), 
					   but she never really needed to.

				<h2>
					6. ‘What’s My Name?‘ – Rihanna
				</h2>
				<p>
						Before she was a billionaire businessperson, Rihanna Robyn Fenty was one of 
						the most reliable and exciting hitmakers in the game. This 2010 collab with 
						fellow A-lister Drake demonstrates her knack for making R&B music that’s 
						catchy but cool, mainstream yet understated. It’s her quiet confidence 
						that really sells it: when Rihanna asks ‘Ooh na na, what's my name?’, 
						she knows the whole world has the answer.

				<h2>
					7. ‘Untitled (How Does It Feel)’ – D’Angelo
				</h2>
				<p>
						If R&B be the music of sweet, sweet love-making (yes, that’s the word we’re using here), 
						then for God’s sake let’s cue up some D’Angelo. Specifically, this glistening 
						anthem from the ‘Brown Sugar’ singer’s 2000 album, ‘Voodoo’. Seduction is everything here, 
						and what’s so glorious about ‘Untitled’ is that for all D’Angelo’s intimate (okay, explicit) 
						come-ons, the music takes its sweet time, slow-building to an ecstatic climax. 
						And then there’s that video…Sophie Harris

					8. ‘My Boo’ – Ghost Town DJs
				</h2>
				<p>
						Heavily influenced by Miami bass (an amped-up hybrid of hip hop and ’80s electro), 
						‘My Boo’ was the first and only hit from the little-known outfit Ghost Town DJs. 
						Filled with silky vocal harmonies layered over punchy beats, it’s instant and infectious, 
						and remains a classic underground old R&B song.

				<h2>
					9. ‘Adorn’ – Miguel
				</h2>
				<p>
						Smooth-singing Miguel toes the line between lothario and sweetheart: 
						in his voice, one can hear shades of a young Marvin Gaye. 
						The dichotomy is laid plain in his impassioned 2012 breakout single, 
						‘Adorn’, a song about love and sex in equal measure.
