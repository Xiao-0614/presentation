			Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or R'n'B, 
		   is a genre of popular music that originated in 
		   African-American communities in the 1940s. 
		   The term was originally used by record companies to 
		   describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, 
		   at a time when "urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, 
		   insistent beat" was becoming more popular.
		   In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical 
			of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually 
			consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, 
			one or more saxophones, and sometimes background vocalists.
			R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American 
			experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy, 
			as well as triumphs and failures in terms of 
			relationships, economics, and aspirations.</p>

		<p>The term "rhythm and blues" has undergone a number of 
			shifts in meaning. In the early 1950s, it was frequently 
			applied to blues records. Starting in the mid-1950s, 
			after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll, 
			the term "R&B" became used to refer to music styles that developed from 
			and incorporated electric blues, as well as gospel and soul music. 
			From 1960s to 1970s, several British R&B musicians such as Jimmy James 
			and the Vagabonds, Geno Washington, Carl Douglas, and Hot Chocolate 
			gained hits. Rock bands such as the Rolling Stones, the Who and the 
			Animals were referred to and promoted as being R&B bands; 
			posters for the Who's residency at the Marquee Club 
			in 1964 contained the slogan, "Maximum R&B". By the end of the 1970s, 
			the term "rhythm and blues" had changed again and was used 
			as a blanket term for soul and funk. In the late 1980s, 
			a newer style of R&B developed, becoming known as "contemporary R&B". 
			It combines rhythm and blues with elements of pop, 
			soul, funk, disco, hip hop, and electronic music.</p>

		<h2>
			3 Characteristics of Classic R&B:
		</h2>

		<p>
			Classic R&B of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s is united by several key elements.
		</p>
		<nav aria-label="classic r&b characteristics">
			<ol>
				<li>1. Strong overlap with rock music: 
					Many of the best R&B acts of this early era were co-categorized 
					as rock â€˜n' roll. These predominantly Black artists in turn 
					inspired many white rock bands, including the Beatles and 
					the Rolling Stones.</li>
				<li>2. Guitar-based instrumentation: 
					The electric guitar was the central instrument in early R&B. 
					It was backed by drums, a double bass (later an electric bass guitar), 
					and piano. Melodies were performed by lead vocalists 
					or the occasional saxophone.</li>
				<li>3. Inspiration from blues and church music:
					Many early R&B artists were steeped in blues and gospel traditions. 
					Some R&B albums from this era contain openly Christian themes, 
					while others reworked blues standards for contemporary audiences.</li>
			</ol>
		</nav>

		<h2>
			3 Characteristics of Contemporary R&B
		</h2>

		<p>
			Contemporary R&B music shares some traits with the original R&B genre but differs in notable ways.
		</p>
		<nav aria-label="contemporary r&b characteristics">
			<ol>
				<li>1. Keyboard-based instrumentation: 
					While early R&B was driven by guitars, most contemporary R&B is based 
					around keyboards, synthesizers, and drum machines. Some R&B singers, 
					like Alicia Keys, favor acoustic piano, but many others embrace 
					electronic keyboards and software loops.</li>
				<li>2. Incorporation of hip hop: 
					In recent years, the line between hip hop and R&B has blurred. 
					Bryson Tiller's debut album Trapsoul and Drake's debut Thank 
					Me Later feature equal parts singing and rapping. 
					The trend dates back to the 1980s, when producers Teddy Riley 
					and Bernard Belle introduced the "new jack swing" style of production.</li>
				<li>3. Smooth, melismatic vocals: 
					R&B singers like Luther Vandross, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey made vocal 
					virtuosity an integral part of the genre upheld by artists 
					like Jazmine Sullivan, Alicia Keys, and Erykah Badu.</li>
			</ol>
